				<h2>IsoP</h2>
				<p>
					IsoP is a program that was originally developed by Carly Delvau. It
					allows the user to estimate isotopic composition of precipitation
					within Canada given latitude, longitude. The program however, was
					written originally in MatLab and was not user friendly. I have since
					rewritten the program in Python and have added a Command Line
					Interface (CLI) to make it more user friendly.

				<h3>Undergraduate Thesis Work</h3>
				<p>
					This was a proof of conccept thesis project I developed in my final
					year of my undergrad. The project uses a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)
					neural network to estimate the isotopic composition of precipitation
					given latitude, longitude, altitude, temperature, and precipitation
					anywhere in Canada. The project was a success, and is now the basis of
					my Master's thesis.
				</p>
				<h3>Master's Thesis Work</h3>
				<p>
					I am currently working on this. It uses the same basic principles of
					the Undergraduate neural network I developed. However, it is supposed to 
					work on a global scale, and will use different features to estimate the
					isotopic composition of precipitation. It will even uses remote sensing tools
					so the user only needs to input latitude, longitude, and dates.
